=======

This project aims to provide an extensible flow collector written in [Scala](http://scala-lang.org), using [Netty](http://netty.io) as IO Framework as well as [Akka](http://akka.io) as Messaging Framework. It is actively being developed by [wasted.io](https://twitter.com/wastedio), so don't forget to follow us on Twitter. :)


## Supported flow-types

- NetFlow v5 - fully
- NetFlow v9 ([RFC3954](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3954)) - almost fully
- NetFlow IPFIX/v10 ([RFC3917](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3917), [RFC3955](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3955)) - untested due to the lack of an exporter


## Supported storage backends

- Currently only the [Redis](http://redis.io) Key-Value-Store is supported


## Future roadmap / what's missing

- NetFlow v1
- NetFlow v6
- NetFlow v7
- NetFlow v9 and v10/IPFIX Sampling and Option flows
- SFlow support
- Cassandra storage support


## What we won't implement

- NetFlow v8 - totally weird format, would take too much time. [Check yourselfâ€¦](http://netflow.caligare.com/netflow_v8.htm)
